"""multicz-go-deps-plugin - claim a Go component by its
compiler-verified import graph instead of a hand-maintained ``paths``
glob.

A Go binary's real dependency graph is whatever ``go list -deps``
says it is. A ``multicz.toml`` ``paths`` glob is whatever someone
remembered to write down. The two drift apart the moment a package
gains a new ``internal/`` import and nobody updates the glob - the
component silently stops seeing changes that should have bumped it.

This package implements :meth:`multicz.plugins.Plugin.affects` - the
one hook that runs *before* path matching has necessarily failed - to
give a component a second chance: if the plain-glob match misses a
changed file, ask the Go compiler's own import graph whether the
file's directory is actually a dependency of that component's binary.

It never *replaces* ``paths``; it only widens what counts as "yes,
this touches me" past what the globs already caught.
